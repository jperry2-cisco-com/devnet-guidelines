# Learning How To Write Learning Labs #

In this document, we will show you how to properly write content for learning labs.

## Objectives ##

Completion Time: 45 minutes

* Understand the Format of a Learning Lab
* Learn how to set up Your Working Directory and Files.
* Pick up Markdown Basics
* Learn how to add Content to the byod.html File
* Understand the Function and use of the JSON File
* Set up and use the Learning Lab Previewer Tool
* Take the Next Step to Writing Learning Labs


## Prerequisites

#### Text Editor
To write content, you will need a powerful text editor which supports Markdown, JSON and HTML syntaxes.  We recommend the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) because it supports mentioned syntaxes and also has built-in Markdown Previewer.

It's a good idea to associate your markdown files such as 1.md with your markdown editor to make file access easier.

#### GIT Installed and Basic Understanding
[GIT](https://git-scm.com/) should be installed and running on your workstation. You should have a basic understanding of GIT. To learn how to use GIT please access the [GIT learning lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/git-intro/step/1)

## Step 1. Understand the Learning Lab Format and Files
The format of a learning lab is the following as listed below and detailed in this document.

1. **Page 1:** Specify the Objectives followed by Prerequisites
  *  The **Objective** should contain the estimated completion time as well as bullet points of the each objective.
  * **Prerequisites** are labs or activities that should be completed or basic knowledge that user should have prior to attempting this lab.  They may also be certain tools that must be set up prior to attempting the lab.

  <br/>
  <br/>
2. Each markdown file, also referred to as a page, should have one Step listed in a heading that corresponds to the page.  
  * For example, page 1 would contain only Step 1 in a heading; page 2 would contain Step 2 in a heading and so forth.  In short, while there can be other headings on a page, each page should contain only one step in a heading and that step number should correspond to the page number.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  *  Each markdown page should have a numeric name corresponding to its order.  For example, page 1 is named 1.md, page 2 is named 2.md and so forth.

  <br/>
  <br/>  
3. Images should be in PNG format and 300 kilobytes or less in size.  Larger image files will drastically slow down the publisher tool when it encodes the images which will slow down production! Under your lab directory create an assets/images subdirectory and store images there. **Image names should be in lower case** to prevent case sensitivity issues.<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>  
4. Images should be added to a page in the following manner: `![](/posts/files/04-rest-04-learning-python-json/assets/images/your_image.png)` where `04-rest-04-learning-python-json` is the lab directory containing subdirectory assets/images and the PNG file is your_image.png
  * The image will not be viewable in your markdown editor; however, it will be viewable in the Learning Lab Previewer tool as well as the in the Production environment where the labs reside for public use.
5.  The **byod.html** known as bring-your-own-device should always contain text providing guidelines for users who want to set up their own devices to interface with the lab.  More detail will be provided later in this lab.<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>  
6. The **JSON file** must have the same name as the directory that houses the lab.  For example, if the directory is 04-rest-04-learning-python-json the json file must be so named 04-rest-04-learning-python-json.json .  Note that the naming scheme 04-rest-04 stands for module 4 rest lab 4. More detail will be provided later in this lab.<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>  
7. Using the Learning Lab Previewer tool is essential as it provides a view into how the lab will appear in the production environment.  **All learning labs writers must preview their work with the Learning Lab Previewer tool and make corrections before requesting publishing.**<br/><br/>
